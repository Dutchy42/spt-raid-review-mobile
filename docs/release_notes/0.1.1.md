## What's Changed

Yo; few changes, so have a read if you're interested. Otherwise, install and have fun!

- 🚀 Performance fixes; updated playback system to use HTML Canvas instead of SVG DOM Elements for faster and smoother animations.
- 💧 Fixed memory leak; discovered memory leak in the playback that would draw 80,000 extra nodes than required, and would continue to build up overtime until the browser crashed (my bad; too little sleep I suppose... no one reads these right?).
- 😪 Project changes; restructured projects so I could start sharing components between private and public instances of Raid Review (coming soon tm).
- 🗺 Playback interface: slight changes to the UI, and better exposure of the positional/heatmap toggle.
- 🧠 Added caching: utilising client side caching for positional and heatmap data, should help with load times.
- 🐞 Bug fixes; other various bug fixes and changes.
- Other changes...

Thanks for reading ✌️
